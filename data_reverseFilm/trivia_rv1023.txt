# "Californication" (2007)
- In season 1 episode 1 there is a panning shot of the city, but all  the cars are driving in reverse.
# "Chowder" (2007) {The Bruised Bluenana/Shnitzel and the Lead Farfel (#1.14)}
- When Chowder is fast-forwarding the episode in "Bruised Bluenana",  the scene where he runs after tearing out of his shirt is playing in  reverse. That one scene is being rewind while the rest are being  fast-forwarded.
# "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" (2015) {Josh and I Work on a Case! (#1.12)}
- At roughly 20 minutes when the camera pans up from the road, the cars are moving backwards.
# "Die Schatzinsel" (1966)
- As the 'Hispanola' wasn't fully capable at sea, the sails could  never be fully filled, as the ship would have capsized. For the  scenes which show the ship in full sail, the ship would be pulled  backwards to fill the sails with air, and the sequence was played in  reverse.
# "Doctor Who" (2005) {Hide (#7.10)}
- The Crooked Man's movements were done in reverse and then played forward, to give it an unnatural movement.
# "Family Guy" (1999) {Yug Ylimaf (#11.4)}
- The plot of the film hinges on time moving in reverse. The episode  title, "Yug Ylimaf" is the name of the show reversed.
- A mistake was made in this episode as the other characters talk  normally, where they should have been talking backwards.
# "Grey's Anatomy" (2005) {A Hard Day's Night (#1.1)}
- The cut scene of the sun rising in fast motion (midway through their  48 hour shift) is actually a shot of the sun setting in Norfolk,  Virginia that is played in reverse to make it look like a sunrise.  Look closely and you can see the cars are going backwards.
# "I Love Lucy" (1951) {Staten Island Ferry (#5.12)}
- When Lucy and Fred fall asleep on the Staten Island Ferry, the boat  is shown in the harbor traveling to and from New York in what is  probably "stock footage", not a scene filmed just for this show.  First, the boat is seen going left to right, the stern in the back  (of course) and the "wake" (small waves at the side of the boat)  showing forward motion. When the boat is shown going in the other  direction, they simply reversed the previous scene, so that now the  vessel is going right to left, stern-first, with the "wake" going  the wrong way.
# "I Love Lucy" (1951) {The Tour (#4.30)}
- When Lucy is discovered in Richard Widmark's house and is trying to  explain how she got there, the conversation is 'punctuated' by shots  of Cap, Widmark's enormous dog, looking back and forth from Lucy to  Widmark and Ricky. In two of the shots, Cap looks directly at the  camera, as if to express amazement at what's being said. Behind him  is an open door, and the legs of a piece of furniture. In the first  of the two shots, Cap turns from looking to his left at Lucy to face  the camera; the open door is behind him, to his right. The second of  these shots is really the same shot, reversed: Cap turns from  looking to his right at Ricky and Widmark to face the camera; now  the open door is behind him, to his left.
# "Mad Men" (2007) {Mystery Date (#5.4)}
- SPOILER: After this episode aired, Slate reported that its director,  Matt Shakman, signals the start of Don's dream sequence (in which he  both has sex with and murders Andrea) by filming Don getting out of  bed to let Andrea in the first time, and then using that same  footage in reverse to show him returning to bed. Slate explains:  "Why? Because this is a dream sequence: Don didn't really get out of  bed, and Shakman signaled this as subtly as possible by using  footage that is, in a sense, 'not real.'"
# "Mystery Science Theater 3000" (1988)
- Whenever the characters see the "movie sign", a blue-screen sequence  shows the camera moving toward the theater through a series of  doors. When the characters exit the theater, the "doors" footage is  played backward to show the camera moving away from the theater. The  props in the hallway (such as flames) also move in reverse.
# "Sailor Moon" (1995)
- The scene where Serena is pushed off the balcony is reversed in the  USA version so it looks like she is being rescued (episode 1.18  "Worth a Princess's Ransom").
# "Salem's Lot" (1979)
- The scenes of the child vampires floating outside of their victims'  windows was partly filmed in reverse to give it a more eerie effect.  Additionally, the actors performed on a boom crane rather than being  suspended on wires.
# "She-Ra: Princess of Power" (1985) {The Stone in the Sword (#1.21)}
- The introduction to the Rebel Camp in Whispering Woods is the same  shot that was seen in  _"She-Ra: Princess of Power" (1985) {Into Etheria (#1.1)}_ (qv), but  played in reverse.
# "Shooting Stars" (1993)
- In the very first Quick Fire Round, George Dawes (Matt Lucas)  screaming at the camera, which was the nose he made, when time ran  out, was filmed in reverse.
# "Sky" (1975)
- The opening sequence in which Sky appears to get covered in leaves  and sticks by unseen hands was achieved by the now primitive method  of blowing off the leaves with a wind machine and then showing the  footage in reverse.
# "That Girl" (1966)
- The train in the opening sequence of the series was shot at Secaucus  Junction, in Secaucus, NJ. It was filmed out of the back of the  train as it headed northwest, then the film was reversed, making it  appear to be heading towards Newark. That is why traffic on the New  Jersey Turnpike (running parallel to the right, with Laurel Hill in  the background) is moving backwards.
# "The Beatles Anthology" (1995) {February '64 to July '64 (#1.3)}
- On the clip of their 2nd appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show" from  Miami Fl. in 1964, the introductory poolside scene is run in reverse  showing the diver coming out of the water and landing on the diving  board feet first.
# "The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961) {Never Name a Duck (#2.1)}
- 'Jerry Hausner' (qv), (the kangaroo owner), tries to get his  kangaroo out of the veterinarian's office, it refused to cooperate  calmly, some of the footage was actually played backwards to give  the effect the chaotic animal is backing up, to prevent filming any  of the mayhem it did cause.
# "The Prisoner" (1967)
- "Rover", the menacing white balloon that acts as a surreal sentry in  The Village, was supposed to have been a large robotic machine.  During the filming of the first episode, it was supposed to travel  across water on a pair of rails hidden under the surface. The  machine fell off the rails and into the water, damaging the motors  inside. Just then, a weather balloon passed by, and  'Patrick McGoohan' (qv) came upon the idea of "Rover" being a large  white balloon that traveled by itself. The reason the cast stands  still as Rover wanders past is because the balloon is being pulled  by a wire. The shots were then run backwards, and edited into the  film (In one episode, smoke can be seen drifting back into a chimney  in the distance as Rover passes by).
# "The Proxy" (2012)
- For the car bomb effect, Daisy Head had to do her action backwards,  which she was oddly a natural at, while the crew rocked the car and  remained out of shot. The footage was then reversed in the edit and  the effects added.
# "The Stand" (1994)
- The shot where the car nearly runs over Nick Andros'  ('Rob Lowe (I)' (qv)) head was shot in reverse.
- The shot with Randall Flagg's hand bending backwards was done by  using makeup on the palm of 'Jamey Sheridan' (qv)'s left hand to  make it look like the back of his right hand.
# "The Twilight Zone" (1959) {You Drive (#5.14)}
- The scene where Oliver's car almost runs into him while he is on the  ground was filmed with the car speeding backwards, away from him.  Then the film was shown in reverse.
# "ZZZap!" (1993)
- The links between the sketches (zooming to each square on the comic)  are obviously filmed backwards: Smoke is moving the other way,  Cuthbert Lilly magically bursting backwards into his paper burst  square, and it would be impossible to get the perfect camera angle  once the square is found.
# 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
- Before the first race there is a deep-focus shot of three of the  drivers in their cars turning one by one to look at Brian. The  slightly unnatural motion of the head and eye movements of the  actors reveals that this shot is running in reverse. As actually  filmed, the action begins with Brian and then moves down the line of  actors, finishing with Suki.
# A Life Less Ordinary (1997)
- The scene where Robert almost hits O'Reilly who is laying in the  road, was shot backwards and then reversed in post production.
# A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987)
- (at around 29 mins) When the clay puppet face turns into Freddy's,  special-effects man 'Doug Beswick' (qv) used stop-motion animation.  Filming began with a clay Freddy face that was made plainer in each  frame. The result was then run backwards, and that is what appears  in the final cut of the film.
- The original "Freddy Snake" unintentionally came out looking too  phallic. The crew only had one hour to film the scene so they didn't  have enough time to paint it. So, it was covered in a green goo  substance to overcome the "pinkish hue." The scene involving the  "Freddy Snake" attempting to swallow Kristen was also filmed  backwards and then played in reverse due to the gums on the puppet  being too flexible and were folding over themselves.
# Alien: Resurrection (1997)
- SPOILER: At appx. 1h 35 mins, to achieve the shot where the camera  travels inside 'Leland Orser' (qv) to see the alien fetus about to  be birthed, Orser had a camera down his throat and then pulled out.  This was then reversed.
# Anaconda (1997)
- At approximately 1 hour 8 min and 27 seconds the boat is shown going  past a waterfall, this waterfall's flow is in reverse.
# Anamnesis: The Memory (2015)
- The second walking scene was achieved by the actor, Ben, walking  backwards and having the action reversed in post, giving a more  surreal effect to the pivotal lead up of the 'all is lost' moment.  If you look closely to the top left of the screen, you can even see  the cars going backwards in the background.
# As Above, So Below (2014)
- SPOILER: The 'hole' the 3 jump down to escape 'hell' is possibly a  reference to Dante's Inferno: to escape hell Dante has to climb down  Satan's hairy belly and into his navel, which - it is said - is the  center of the earth. Here gravity is reversed, down becomes up,  hence the jump and fall return them to street level above.
# Bad Day at Black Rock (1955)
- The opening shot with the train was added after preview audiences  did not like the original version. The sequence was created by  filming with a helicopter flying away from the train and running the  film backwards.
# Beetlejuice (1988)
- According to 'Dick Cavett' (qv), 'Tim Burton (I)' (qv) tried to film  the scene where shrimp jump off the plates and attack the dinner  party by positioning stage hands beneath the table and throwing  them. Cavett suggested placing the shrimp on their faces, filming  them as they fell off, then running the film in reverse - which  Burton did.
# Berlin (2008/I)
- In the beginning, the soccer ball in the background has a unique  bounce to it. This is because this opening clip was originally  intended to be the end of the film, and the camera craned up INTO  the tree. After a screening of the rough cut, it was decided to  bookend the film with the park scene, and this clip was the reversed  to bring us OUT of the tree down to the elderly couple, giving the  ball the unique bounce, because the action was also reversed.
# Biloxi Blues (1988)
- The opening and closing scenes, of a train crossing a bridge, are  the same shot. The closing scene is merely reversed.
# Blades (1989)
- The shot where the camera quickly zooms in on the couple was  actually done in reverse. A camera was attached to a truck and  driven in reverse, starting from the couple until they can't be seen  anymore.
# Bless the Child (2000)
- When the candles in the cathedral ignite together, the camera pulls  back and Maggie's shirt can be seen blowing, as if the candles were  in fact being blown out, and film was run backwards.
# Boomerang (1992)
- The scene where Marcus, Gerard, and Tyler hug in front of the Empire  State Building was shot at 2AM when the tower lights are always shut  off. The film was reversed to make it appear that the lights were  turned on. It would have cost $40,000-$60,000 to have the lights  turned on.
- The scene late in the film where 'David Alan Grier' (qv),  'Martin Lawrence (I)' (qv), and 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) hug in front  of the Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in  the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers  had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them  $40-$60,000, so instead 'Reginald Hudlin (I)' (qv) had the three  hug, and the lights were eventually shut off as usual. When editing  the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if  the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about  ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus  attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate  ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and  Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the  filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually  came up with the released version.
# Brick (2005)
- To cheaply create the effect of something coming out of the tunnel  and jumping up in the observer's face, the dream sequence in which  Brendan sees Emily coming out of the tunnel is shot in reverse. You  can see this because the water appears to be flowing out of the  tunnel, while in all the other shots, it's flowing in.
- The opening scene, with Brendan looking at Emily's body, is very  deceptively shot. What appear to be POV shots of Emily's body are in  fact something else. Director Rian Johnson says, "Brendan's eye-line  never changes. We see him ostensibly looking at different details  each time, but that's never cued by eye movement. Those inserts  aren't from the angle at which he's viewing them. From where he is,  her feet should be at the top of the frame; instead, they're at the  bottom, shot from her other side. The other two shots are likewise  reversed. You could call that an error, I suppose, but coupled with  the fixed eye-line, what it suggests is that Brendan can't process  what he's seeing. It's so unthinkable to him that he can only take  in tiny portions at a time. He's abstracted the sight of her into  objects. The images are technically 'wrong,' but that contributes to  the scene's overwhelming sense of wrongness.I know that when I see  something traumatic, I don't really process it in the moment, but I  store it with an intense amount of detail and then watch the memory  of it very carefully. Those disconnected, weirdly beautiful pieces  of Emily are not what Brendan would see from his vantage point, but  they feel like what he'd remember from the scene."
# Brigadoon (1954)
- To get the effect of Brigadoon emerging from the mist,  'Vincente Minnelli' (qv) filmed the sets with the fog being pumped  in, then reversed the shot to show the mist moving away.
# Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
- In the scene where Frank attempts to save Rose, the actors acted out  their movements in reverse. The sequence itself was then played in  reverse. This adds to the dreamlike effect of the scene in which the  snow rises.
# Burnt Offerings (1976)
- The shot where the vines seize 'Oliver Reed (I)' (qv)'s legs during  the escape attempt were actually done in reverse. The vines were  originally unwrapped from the legs and dragged off, but in reverse  the vines appear to grab his legs.
# CaCo3 (2014)
- SPOILER: At the end where Chalkface re-emerges from the cabin; the  first take saw actor Stephen Radford accidentally crack heads with  Andrew Lewin. The Chalkface mask didn't have eyes so judging  distance was reliant on sound cues. After this head-knocking  accident, it was decided that the moment be filmed in reverse  allowing the actors avoid sustaining cranial injuries from the many  takes that were done to capture the moment.
# Candy (1968)
- The sequence of the nurse assisting Dr. Krankheit put on his latex  operating gloves is a clever reverse film of pulling the gloves off.
# Capricorn One (1977)
- The sunrise at the launch complex at the beginning of the film is  actually a sunset played backwards.
# Carrie (1976)
- SPOILER: In the second-to-last scene (where 'Amy Irving (I)' (qv)  lays flowers on Carrie's grave) to make it more "eerie", the shot  was filmed backwards - then run in reverse in slo-mo - to give it a  surreal effect. This is evidenced by a background automobile  traversing the perpendicular intersection backwards, which the  viewer can clearly observe as driving in reverse.
- SPOILER: To create the scene where Margaret White is stabbed by  flying knives, it was filmed in reverse and began with her pinned to  the wall, then strings pulled out the knives and the final film was  run backwards.
# Cats & Dogs (2001)
- The scene where Sophie revives Mr. Mason by pounding on his chest  was filmed in reverse
# Chelovek s kino-apparatom (1929)
- A revelation in its day, the film was noted for introducing all  sorts of camera techniques to audiences. Some of these include  double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, jump cuts,  split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots,  backwards footage and stop motion animation.
# Chisum (1970)
- The Zoom in and zoom out sequences of Chisum sitting on his horse on  the hillside at the beginning and end of the movie are the same  footage. The original shot was the zoom out used at the end. That  was reversed to produce the zoom in used at the beginning.
# Christine (1983)
- To simulate the car regenerating itself, hydraulic pumps were  installed on the inside of some of the film's numerous Plymouth Fury  "stunt doubles", a mock-up in plastic that looked more like metal on  camera than actual metal as it bent and deformed. These pumps were  attached to cables, which were in turn attached to the cars'  bodywork and when they compressed, they would "suck" the paneling  inwards. Footage of the inward crumpling body was then reversed,  giving the appearance of the car spontaneously retaking form.
# Cleveland in My Dreams (2005)
- When the camera dollies into the restaurant, the dolly really pulled  back and the shot was reversed in post-production. The bartender had  to walk backwards.
# Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)
- SPOILER: The second half of the final scene with Lisa begging Caesar  to show mercy and him giving his "equality" speech was added after  the film's completion. This is why the final shot is only of  Caesar's eyes and is of a grainy quality; the shot was just a  cropped piece of footage from earlier in the film.  'Roddy McDowall' (qv) was brought in the read the final lines, which  were then edited into place. Originally the film ended on a darker  note, with the gorillas mercilessly beating Breck and the other  human survivors to death with their rifle butts (see alternate  versions). Much of the same footage exists in both endings, but in  the revised version film of the apes raising their rifles is played  in reverse so it appears they are lowering them, and footage of the  apes beating is cut to make it appear that they are cheering.
# De lift (1983)
- All the actors performed their own stunts, as there were no actual  stunt men on this film. For instance, to keep the actors safe, the  scene in which 'Gerard Thoolen (I)' (qv)'s head gets stuck between  the elevator doors was filmed backwards.
# Dinner Time (2014)
- In order to work with the difficult medium of real food, Portly Pig  Studios shot the frames in reverse. That way, instead of the world  looking as though it is wilting in certain shots - it looks as  though it is coming to life.
# Dracula (1992)
- The scene of Lucy ('Sadie Frost' (qv)) getting back into her coffin  in the underground crypt was shot in reverse to give it an eerie  quality.
# Dèmoni 2... l'incubo ritorna (1986)
- The resurrection of the first demon was done by shooting a melting  wax head in reverse.
# Eschew (2016)
- Close to 50 percent of the film is actually played backwards.
# Evil Dead II (1987)
- The eyeball swallowing shot was actually filmed in reverse.
# Fahrenheit 451 (1966)
- The scene where the fireman first put on his gear, is filmed in  reverse. The same scene but in normal run is used again later for  him to take out his gear.
# Fail-Safe (1964)
- The view of the satellite zooming into a closer shot is actually  film taken from a camera mounted on a captured German V2 rocket  launched from White Sands, New Mexico. The film is run backwards to  show the illusion of zooming closer to the ground.
# Family Business (1989)
- The camera shot at the end of the film is in reverse from the shot  at the beginning.
# Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)
- The scene in which Raoul Duke calls his attorney from Baker is  partially filmed backwards. In the back ground smoke can be seen  coming back into a fire, and Duke bangs in reverse on the side of  the phone booth.
# Final Destination (2000)
- SPOILER: In Tod's death scene, the shot of the leaking water was  played forward as it came out. The footage was simply rolled  backwards to give the effect that it is sucked back under the  toilet.
- SPOILER: The piece of glass that went into Ms. Lewton's neck from  the computer was done backwards - they shot the glass being yanked  away from her neck with a line (which was digitally erased).
# Finale (2009/I)
- The tracking shot of fire racing down a trail of kerosene towards  the camera was shot in reverse, with the DP Ryan Harris literally  running through the flames.
# Frankenstein (1910)
- This is one of the only Frankenstein films where the monster is  truly created. All Frankenstein films that followed assembled body  parts from various corpses to make the monster. In this film,  Frankenstein uses chemicals and "potions" to create the monster. The  "creation" scene was made by filming a monster-dummy burning, and  then playing the footage backwards.
# Get Crazy (1983)
- When Piggy is banging his head on the concrete retaining wall and  the crowd is counting, it's actually the same quick shot run  backward and forward several times.
# Get Him Back (2008)
- All the visual effects are in-camera. The "time-slip" effect was  achieved by having the actress walk very slowly backward through the  crowds in Times Square, then reversing and speeding up the video.
# Girl Happy (1965)
- When Rusty is backing the boat trailer up to deliver Valerie (and  Romano) to the motel, the frames are segmented resulting in a jumpy image. This is because Rusty is actually driving forward and the film has been reversed.
# Gone (2010/V)
- The car crash scene was acted backwards and then reserved to get the  effect the car was coming towards the actor.
# Guest House Paradiso (1999)
- The scene in which Ritchie yanks Eddie's head back with a hook up  his nose was shot with the action in reverse, then played backwards  in the final cut. To achieve this, Adrian Edmondson learned to  phonetically pronounce the phrase "Excuse me one moment" backwards.
- The scene which Richie sticks meathooks in Eddie's nose and Eddie  says "Excuse me one moment!" was filmed in reverse, with Eddie  saying his line backwards "Tnemom eno em escuxe!"
# Heroin: A Love Story (2013)
- The short scene involving beer being splashed on a party goer was  reversed, to be less confusing to the viewer.
# History of the World: Part I (1981)
- The scene where the showgirls rise out of the water (the Inquisition  routine) is actually being played in reverse. The shot was of the  girls being lowered.

- The final shot actually repeats the same short bit of action  backward and forward several times (smoke can be seen rising and  then going back down, for instance) before finally going to a freeze  frame
# Im Juli. (2000)
- The moment when Daniel sees Melek for the first time, the walking  scene is shot reverse for Melek and played backwards to make a more  charming introduction.
# Invaders from Mars (1953)
- The sandpit opening and closing was done by cutting a long slit in a  piece of heavy canvas and inserting a large funnel. A hose from a  powerful vacuum was attached to the funnel and the whole thing was  then covered with sand. The vacuum was activated and the sand was  sucked down for the shots of the sandpit opening. Moreover, the film  was simply reversed for shots of the sandpit closing.
# Irreversible (2004)
- Some shots were easier to film backwards instead of forwards. Since  the movie was already half played in reverse, most shots were filmed  in the direction that was most convenient.
# Jackass Number Two (2006)
- The initial scene of Steve-O coming out of the water while he's  standing in the giant ring, before it lights on fire, is actually a  clip of him going into the water and then played in reverse.

- The opening shot of the camera zooming-in on the lizard was actually  filmed in reverse.

- A number of scenes featuring the character, Malice Valeria, were  filmed with her doing her blocking movements in reverse, to give a  subtle non-human aspect to her interactions.
# La belle et la bête (1946)
- The effect of the candles lighting themselves as the merchant passes  them was achieved by blowing them out and then running the film in  reverse as he walked backward past them. The entire sequence was  done in one long take and reversed - a quick glimpse of the  fireplace shows the flames appearing to move downward.
# Legend (1985)
- In the scene when Blix is approaching the unicorn to takes its horn,  the unicorn 'falling down' is actually footage of the horse standing  up shown backwards to make it appear that it's struggling to stay  standing.
# Mogambo (1953)
- According to director Martin Scorsese, the scene in which the native  tribe are throwing spears at Clark Gable was filmed in reverse.
# Mute Witness (1995)
- Director 'Anthony Waller (I)' (qv) filmed 'Alec Guinness' (qv)'  scenes nine years before the rest of the film from an earlier draft  of the screenplay. Guinness gave his performance in one morning  before catching a plane. When Waller needed an additional scene, he  used the film from earlier and reversed it.
# Nostalgia in Motion (2008)
- This film was shot in one continuous take with great consideration  and care given to the movement and placement of the hands. In  editing, reverse motion was used in order to create the restoration  effect.
# Oh, How the Times Have Changed! (2012)
- The vintage vehicles were models shot in front of a green screen.  They were set in motion by starting them near the camera lens and  blown backwards with a hair dryer. The film was reversed in editing  and combined with the dirt road plate shot thus making it appear the  car was speeding down the road toward camera.
# Oh, Mr. Porter! (1937)
- The 'driver's cab view' along the track at the beginning of the film  was actually filmed by hanging a camera out of the end of the train,  then showing the resulting footage backwards: this is why the train  appears to be engaging in 'wrong-track' running throughout this  section!
# One Hour in Wonderland (1950) (TV)
- The opening scene with Santa Claus was filmed backwards so that he  could appear to levitate the gifts out of the bag.
# Performance (1970)
- The scene in which Chas is escorted out of Powis Square by thugs has  one shot which has been reversed; if you look carefully you'll see a  boy walking backward and cars driving in reverse.
# Phantasm (1979)
- The "ball" scenes were simple special effects. The sphere was thrown  from behind the camera by a baseball pitcher and then the shot was  printed in reverse. The ball attaching itself to the man's head was  filmed by sticking it on his head, then pulling it off, and printing  the shot in reverse.
# Pizza: The Movie (2004)
- After Kevin asks Barry about "the plan", Barry looks up at Kevin.  This shot is shown in reverse (from Barry originally looking down)  when the director realized he didn't have a appropriate reaction  shot of ('Jason Muzie' (qv)) This shot occurs after Kevin delivers  the line: "amazing emotional highs...us together?"

# Raising Arizona (1987)
- SPOILER: The shot where Evelle and Gale stop just before hitting the  car seat with the baby in it, was filmed in reverse, with the car  driving away from the seat.
# Reap the Wild Wind (1942)
- The shots of the squid wrapping its tentacles around the actors was  done by wrapping the actors in the tentacles, then unwrapping them  and showing the film in reverse.
# Ringu (1998)
- The effect of Sadako coming out of the well was accomplished with  only one simple special effect. 'Rie Ino'o' (qv), who is a student  of the Kabuki theatre, which uses exaggerated motion and jerking  movements to emphasize emotion, was heavily involved in the  development of the Sadako character. Ino'o was filmed walking  backwards and the film was run in reverse - the end result is Sadako  walking forwards with unnatural motions.
# Secrets (2010/I)
- The film was shot in reverse.
# Selfless (2012)
- The opening was shot using two parallel mirrors placed perpendicular  to a rigid poster board with the world Selfless on it. A tinted  glass pane was set at a 45 degree angle to one of the mirrors. With  precise lighting conditions, the camera, aimed directly through the  tinted glass, shot the word reversed on one mirror while the image  appeared correctly oriented on the tinted glass, having been  reversed twice, once by the second mirror and once by the tinted  glass. One of the words could be wiped away by slipping a piece a  black cardboard between the second mirror and tinted glass. The  poster board was attached to a drill, which made it spin. The entire  sequence was shot in reverse, then reversed in post production.
# Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (2001)
- The scene at the end of the film where Chihiro and her parents are  walking through the tunnel back to the car is the exact same scene  as the one in the beginning of the film, only reversed.
# Shane (1953)
- During the filming 'Jack Palance' (qv) had problems with his horse.  In the scene at the Starrett ranch where 'Alan Ladd (I)' (qv)  (Shane) and Palance (Jack Wilson) first look each other over.  Palance was to dismount for a minute then remount his horse. He  could not remount, so the director had Jack dismount his horse  slowly, then ran the film in reverse for the remount.
# Shoggoth (2012)
- When Carl, Joseph and Phillip waits in the car for Sarah, the short shot before Joseph leaves the car is played backwards.
# Silent Hill (2006)
- The strange stumbling movements of the Dark Nurses when they first  "come alive" was created by filming them walking backwards, and then  running the film in reverse.
# Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
- Scenes of straightforward dialog maybe comprised of up to 6 layers  of computer-composited imagery as the following example shows. In  one scene, 'Natalie Portman' (qv)'s best take had been take seven  while 'Jake Lloyd (I)' (qv)'s was take one. The two takes were  spliced together. However, Lloyd's mouth at the end of the scene is  still gaped open, so the same segment from take fifteen (in which  his mouth is closed) is patched in. Furthermore, when Portman  appears to look down from Lloyd instead of up, those few seconds  were run backwards, which unexpectedly caused steam in the  background to rise in reverse. The problem was fixed by flipping the  steam backwards. All these fixes resulted in a seamless scene. This  technique prompted 'Liam Neeson' (qv), upon the film's release, to  complain thus, "We are basically puppets. I don't think I can live  with the inauthenticity of movies anymore."
# Step Up 2: The Streets (2008)
- Some of the dance moves in the last dance is played backwards. You  can tell by Andie's hair moving the wrong way when moving
# Superman (1978)
- The film of the black-and-white sequence that opens the movie is  shown in reverse. The sequence was filmed starting with a close-up  of the Daily Planet panel followed by a zoom-out. Then the child's  hand turns each page left-to-right, then closes the cover. (As the  child turns each page and then closes the cover, notice that the  corners fold in the opposite direction of how they should fold.)
# Sweet Liberty (1986)
- The scene where Alan and Michael are driving a convertible and stop  just in time before they are hit by a train, was filmed in reverse.  The train was run backwards along with the car during filming.
# The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
- To depict the seamless closing of the ship and its ramp, they just  reversed the film of the shot of the ship's ramp and door appearing.
# The Doorway (2010) (V)
- The creature effects were created in camera, with the exception of  the stop motion. The tentacles attacking were wrapped around the  actor's hand or leg, and pulled. Then this was reversed in Post  Production.
# The Exorcist (1973)
- In the scene where the words "help me" arise out of Regan's torso,  the effect was achieved by constructing a foam latex replica of  actress 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv)'s belly, writing the words out with a  paint brush and cleaning fluid, then filming the words as they  formed from the chemical reaction. Special effects artist  'Dick Smith (II)' (qv) then heated the forming blisters with a blow  dryer, causing them to deflate. When the film was run backwards, it  appeared as though the words were rising out of young Regan's skin  in an attempt to summon intervention.
# The Flintstones (1994)
- When Fred flies into his car at the beginning of the movie, after  sliding off the Bronto-crane, 'John Goodman (I)' (qv) was actually  lifted by a crane out of the car and the footage was just shown in  reverse. This actually explains why the roof of Fred's car appears  shorter during this scene, than it does for the rest of the movie.  As a shorter roof would be necessary to shoot such a scene.
# The Fog (1980)
- SPOILER: In the last scene where Stevie is on top of the lighthouse  and the fog slowly disappears, the crew realized they wouldn't be  able to get the fog to roll out, so they had 'Adrienne Barbeau' (qv)  do the scene in reverse.
# The Haunting (1963)
- According to 'Robert Wise (I)' (qv), the spiral staircase, provided  some unique challenges. "It was scary when you were up on that thing  and it was rocking around. The one shot we did on it that fascinates  people the most is when the camera is at the bottom and goes up. We  designed the banister of the stairway to be so wide and thick that  it would fit a small rig with wheels on it--a little, light dolly  that would hold a hand-held camera. We had our camera on that and we  had a control wire underneath, all the way down. We simply took the  camera up to the top on this rig, started it, rolled it down, and  then reversed the film. It was all done on that balustrade."
# The Last Five Years (2014)
- Near the end of Still Hurting when Cathy sits down on the bench in  front of the bed is actually a shot in reverse. That's why it looks  like a sharp movement when she "sits."
# The Mire (2010)
- The overhead shot of The Man in the second half was shot in reverse,  mirror perspective to set the audience off guard and create a sense  of unrest.
# The Other Way (2014/I)
- Actor 'Bryson Maddock' (qv) had to walk backwards in the scene where  his character, Matthew Wendall, walks forwards. This shot was then  reversed so that it looks as if he were walking forwards while  everybody else walked backwards.
- The shower sequence within the film is in reverse.
# The Owl (2014/I)
- The shot of Dawson getting out of bed and walking to the window when  first seeing the owl was actually shot in reverse and played  forwards in post to create a strange sense of unusual motion.
# The Phantom of the Opera (2004)
- In the scene where Raoul falls onto water and is nearly drowned, the  footage is played on reverse to make it seem that  'Patrick Wilson (I)' (qv) is underwater longer than he really is. If  looked at carefully, air bubbles can be seen going back into his  nose
# The Reluctant Dragon (1941/I)
- When 'Robert Benchley' (qv) visits the art department one of the  sculptors quickly makes a clay bust caricature of Benchley. In  reality the bust was made in advance and then gradually destroyed  while being filmed. The film was simply shown backwards to make it  appear as though the artist was making the bust from scratch.
# The Rounders (1914)
- One of the shots is shown in reverse to give the impression that  Arbuckle and Chaplin rush to the edge of a lake and Chaplin almost  falls in. As a tipoff to this technique, watch for the man walking  backward in the background, and compare the rippling waves in the  shot with the direction of the rippling in the following lakeside  shot.
# The Suffering: Static (2003)
- The dream sequences were filmed backwards. The actors moved in  reverse, playing out the actions from end to beginning.
# The Ten Commandments (1923)
- The effect of the parting of the Red Sea was created by placing two  blocks of blue gelatin side-by-side, heating them until they  melted...then running the footage in reverse.
# The Ten Commandments (1956)
- Special Effects Property Master 'William Sapp' (qv) created the  effects that turned the waters of the Nile red. Red dye was pumped  into the water through a hose at the point where Aaron touched the  river, with his staff. Sapp also created the vessel that was used by  Rameses' priest in an attempt to restore the waters. The vessel had  two chambers: one that was filled with clear water and which was  located near the vessel's opening, while the other chamber was  filled with red-dyed water was located near the bottom of the  vessel. As the vessel was tipped to empty its contents, the clear  water poured out first, and as the vessel was tipped further, this  released the red-dyed water into the "river" on the sound stage.  There were six of these vessels that were made for the film, but  only two were used during production. The reverse shot showing the  red water extending out into the sea was created through animation  onto shots of the Red Sea that had been photographed in Egypt.
- The illusion of the Red Sea parting was achieved by large "dump  tanks" that were flooded, then the film was shown in reverse. The  two frothing walls of water were created by water dumped constantly  into "catch basin areas" then the foaming, churning water was  visually manipulated and used sideways for the walls of water. A  gelatin substance was added to the water in the tanks to give it  more of a sea water consistency. Although the dump tanks have long  since been removed, the catch basin section of this tank still  exists today on the Paramount lot, directly in front of the exterior  sky backdrop, in the central portion of the studio. It can still be  flooded for water scenes, but when not being used in a production,  it is an extension of a parking lot.
# This... Is the Orange Line (2010)
- The first clip in the movie with the opening credits is also the  ending clip only in reverse.
# Threads (1984) (TV)
- In the aftermath of the nuclear blast, footage of a cat supposedly  "suffocating" outside in the extreme heat is shown. This is actually  footage of a cat enjoying a hefty dose of catnip, then they just  reversed the film to give the impression of the cat suffocating (the  way the cat is rolling on the ground is the giveaway).
# Thunderball (1965)
- In at least two shots in the scene where Number One accuses his  underlings of embezzlement, the unnatural eye movements and blinking  motions of the actors reveal that the film is actually being run  backwards.
# To Live and Die in L.A. (1985)
- The freeway car chase was filmed with the traffic flowing backwards.  While Chance and Vukovich appear to be driving against traffic, they  are in fact going in the proper direction for the U.S.; it is the  rest of traffic that's moving on the wrong side of the road (Chance  drives on the right side of the road, but the traffic is driving on  the left). This was done to increase tension for the audience.
# Top Secret! (1984)
- The scene where Hillary and Nick go into the Swedish bookstore was  staged, shot and then run backwards to make the dialog sound  "unique." If you record the scene and play it backwards, you will  find all of the dialogue to be exactly what is shown in the  subtitles except for the title of the book Hillary asks for. The  title she actually asks for is "Europe On 5 Quaaludes A Day."
- The Swedish Bookstore scene has no cuts and lasts for 88 seconds.  Amusingly, like the scene, 88 makes sense forwards AND backwards.
# Vampirella (1996) (V)
- The space sequence of Vlad and his cohorts leaving Drakulon is  footage from _Not of This Earth (1988)_ (qv), run in reverse. Both  films were directed by 'Jim Wynorski' (qv).
# Waxwork (1988)
- 'Patrick Tantalo' (qv) said that the Zombie sequence was filmed in  one night in Griffith Park. Because they only had one night to film  the sequence, the scene where a severed Zombie hand grabs Zach  Galligan (Mark) on the wrist was filmed in reverse.
# X (1963)
- To create the effect of being able to see through a building, the  director filmed the construction of the building in time lapse, then  ran the film backward.
# Yôjinbô (1961)
- In one scene, the samurai shows incredible skill at knife-throwing  by impaling a blowing leaf against a wooden floor. This was  accomplished by running the shot backwards. In the frame before the  knife hits the leaf, you can see a slit in the leaf the same size  and at the exact point where the knife penetrates it a frame later.
# Zardoz (1974)
- To make the shots of the stone head move into the mouth accurately,  the camera was placed at the mouth and tracked backwards, and the film reversed in the lab.
